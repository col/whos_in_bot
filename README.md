## Usage

Simply add [@WhosInBot](https://telegram.me/whosinbot) to your group chat and send a '/start_roll_call' to start
recording who will be attending an event.

Members of the group chat can respond with '/in', '/out' or '/maybe'. They can
even provide a reason after the command. ie) '/out injured'.

Each time someone responds [@WhosInBot](https://telegram.me/whosinbot) will print the attendee list.

```
Dinner on Friday
1. Sam
2. John
3. Chris

Out
- James (on holiday)
```

You can clear all the responses and start a new roll call by sending '/start_roll_call' again.
